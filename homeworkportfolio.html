<h1> This is my Homework Portfolio</h1>

    <!-- A div that contains a group of items for week 1. Can be useful for setting background colours etc.  -->
    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h1>Week 1.</h1>
        <h3>GDP</h3>
        <p>This first chart tracks UK GDP over time.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>GNI</h3>
        <p>My second chart looks at GNI in the UK</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        
                                      
        <h1>Week 2.</h1> 
        <h3<IMF Lending</h3>
        <p>This chart hosts CSV data on IMF lending.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
        
        <h3<IMF Lending relative to GDP</h3>
        <p>This chart divides the data above through by GDP to show IMF lending as a percentage of GDP.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
    
<p>During this period, the IMF lent most in 1984 (relative to GDP), suggesting that this was a riskier year to invest in than today, when lending is at a peak only in absolute terms.</p>
 
        <h1>Week 3.</h1> 
        <h3<Maturity</h3>
        <p>This chart embeds data on gilt strip yields into a chart specification, by converting CSV cell data into a dictionaries format.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>

<p>Before I got to this stage, I first created my own simple chart where I manually wrote out dictionaries. This is an imaginary example of how many hours of work I completed in January 2020.</p> 
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div> 

<p>Doing this helped me to understand how I needed to manipulate the CSV yield data to embed it into the chart specification.</p>

 <h1>Week 4.</h1> 
        <h3<Olympic Medals</h3>
        <p>This chart shows data that I retrieved from the Olympics website using a scraper in python. The code I wrote to do this can be seen
